# SSH-PROXY
SSH proxy program to bypass geo-locking


PROBLEM: My friend wants to connect to a service in the US. However, he cannot use a normal vpn because the service's owners registers VPN.

SOLUTION: Using SSH tunelling to access the service. This program creates a tunnel to a computer in the US which accesses the service on our behalf.

ADVANTAGE: Any computer can become our very own proxy server.
